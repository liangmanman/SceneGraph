How my program takes the input scene graph file:
                    InputStream in = getClass().getClassLoader()
                            .getResourceAsStream
                                    ("scenegraphs/two-spiders" +
                                    ".xml");
                    view.initScenegraph(canvas,in);
                    
                    // in Frame class
